### Hi!  :wave:

My name is **Gabriel**, and I am a **computer engineer** with a focus on problem-solving mainly with **machine learning** and **software development**.

I have a bachelor's degree in computer engineering at the University of Pernambuco (UPE) since 2018. I'm currently finishing my master's degree also in computer engineering at UPE with a focus on computational intelligence. My main areas of interest are bio-inspired algorithms, including swarm intelligence techniques and neural networks. Also, I'm currently reading a lot about complexity, graph theory, and network science.

At the software engineering perspective, I'm a practical developer with solid object-oriented programming concepts and an enthusiast of the functional programming paradigm. I have experience working with web development in agile and remote teams.

### My projects  :computer:

I'm currently working at PickCells, implementing a scalable platform to automate health exams powered by AI. It provides a significant amount of technical challenges, including horizontal scaling, use of web frameworks, adaptive algorithms for complex problem-solving. Thereby, it requires me to look for better solutions continuously.

Therefore, I'm frequently experimenting and learning new tools and implementing my ideas. This profile hosts these experiments and projects, which I try to keep it as organized as possible. Also, I'm developing a personal webpage with blogging capabilities to discuss these projects in a more detailed manner.

### About me  :sunglasses:
